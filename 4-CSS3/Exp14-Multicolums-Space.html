    Working at a startup might mean extra long days and endless work, but for this co-founder the task of building his startup over the last seven months has meant little to no sleep and 18 hour- working days.
    In a post on LinkedIn, Tushar S shared a lengthy post for his co-founder Abhinash, who has been working on developing their company, Vaani, which is developing human-like Voice AI systems.
    Introducing his colleague, the CEO said that Abhinash Khare starts his day at 8 am and works till 2 am in the night. He even sleeps close to his computer systems so he can quickly start work in the morning without wasting any time.
My cofounder. His bed is 3 feet away from his computer systems, and he jumps straight to the screen as soon as he wakes up. No water, no morning routine — straight to work to build AI infrastructure for our homegrown start-up Vaani Research Labs. It’s been almost 7 months of coding until 2 AM, waking up at 8 AM, and diving right back into research papers and code.
I am aware that the priorities might be a little off and neither glorifying the hustle, but he's willing to push the boundaries because we know what's at stake.
Building a start-up is tough.
Building a start-up without any resources or funding is tougher.
Building a start-up by quitting a high-paying (and I mean CRAZY high-paying) job with no external backing? That’s next-level.
I’ve seen Abhinash do all of this.. quietly, tirelessly, and with that messy hair we all love. He's the real engine behind Vaani. While most people talk about the hustle, my cofounder lives it. He’s proof that passion, grit, and a bit of madness are what it takes to build something groundbreaking.
Here’s to all the co-founders who are the silent warriors behind every great idea. Entrepreneurs, investors, hustlers—you know the grind. This is what it looks like in real life.
EDIT: Most of you have showed a concern about our health and work-life balance. We're overwhelmed and grateful to see the responses. Of course, nobody wants to grind day-in day-out for months; but sometimes you just have no choice and no resources. Thus as I posted previously, to be a little more resourceful, we're currently raising our Angel round. If any Angel wants to join the pool, please ping me at ‘tushar@vaaniresearch.com’ for the round details. Thank you!
